Yesterday was the first time I got high. It was amazing.

Here's what happened— every sensation became more intense. The cold felt colder. The warmth felt warmer. Hal's BBQ chips from the office pantry tasted heavenly. Funny things became hilarious.

Since I was in a happy mood and with good company, I felt happier.

I like this feeling better than getting drunk. Getting drunk numbs everything. You don't taste things as well. Conversations are vapid and blurry. And, for some reason, there's a point at which I feel somber. Just gloomy and numb.

I imagine that for someone who's in a bad mood, getting high might be a mistake. You intensify every emotion you're feeling. In that situation, alcohol might be a better way to alter your consciousness.

But drinking comes with some costs—hangovers, puking, ruining your liver. I don't think the costs of getting high are that bad.

The only thing I hate about weed is the smell. It's disgusting. And, it lingers.

I hope to get high again soon.
