Although this isn't a one-week report, I figured it's best to start one anyways and track my progress on the #120DayMBA challenge. 

## What went well

Ideation went very well. I used [this](https://www.notion.so/824e2578072e4247a5fdc989bcd229cb) template to list out the pros and cons of each and every idea that pops into my mind and eliminate the non-preferrable ones. Being focused requires you to cut out ideas that are good to focus on the ones that are great at this point in time.

The ones that I decided were great were:

1. TikTok lead generator: This was inspired by a tweet. I started off exploring TikTok APIs and realized that there are some awesome unofficial ones. The one I came across was [this one](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api). I decided to create a database in airtable and generate TikTok leads and other metrics for different search queries. I would have a grid in my app that would pull data from this API based on some search queries and then allow the user to generate excel files for the leads that match the search queries.
2. GPT-3 + social media posting and scheduling tool: Social media scheduling tools are all the craze now. They also aren't terribly hard to build with the APIs that the companies provide. For example, Twitter has an amazing API that would be perfect for an MVP.

Another thing that went well is my progress. I have been slow but I have been making some progress by waking up every morning to a Focusmate session and working on exactly one problem a day.

## What didn't go so well

### 1. Discipline

When building these apps, I am definitely facing some sort of decision fatigue. Seeing all the possible options and thinking through which ones I should focus on in a deliberate, systematic way is becoming very difficult.

This is especially evident when something you decided earlier is suddenly not possible to implement in a future time. For example, with the TikTok API, a week ago, I was able to generate a list of videos per user. Now, suddenly, that feature is not working. I ended up spending time investigating what was wrong and trying to understand how I could fix it rather than looking for the next best option.

It's ok to fall down rabbit holes like this from time to time. But as part-time indie hackers, our most precious resource is time. If we're wasting time trying to stick to the first best option, this is time away from our customers and time away from getting actual, useful feedback.

Discipline comes in many forms:

- the kind where you wake up early every morning to work on your project

    This is the most obvious kind. If you aren't working on your goals every day, your goals will slip away from you.

    Admittedly, I haven't been super disciplined in my work because of obligations with my family and work. I haven't been able to put in enough hours into my side projects.

    A way to combat this might be to just pull all-nighters the day I am excited about a project instead of planning and waiting for the right time to come. It's a lot better to just finish something and be able to have a working product—no matter how shabby it is— than to wait until motivation has diluted.

- the kind where you constantly question if what you're doing is getting you closer to your goals

    The way to combat decision fatigue when you're working on a nebulous task is to constantly question yourself if what you're doing is getting you closer to your goals.

    Work cycles have been immensely helpful with this. I just need to remember to do this every time I'm working.

- the kind where you focus on a defined task for a set period

	Focusmate and writing hours have been immensely useful for this. I usually book some time in advance and stick to those times unless I *have*  to cancel. I like this because I can focus on only one thing at a given period in time and I know that if I'm surfing Twitter or something, I am not doing what I set out to do.

	However, this method falls through when I'm doing things that aren't defined. For eg., it's very easy for me to go on a "best JS grid library" hole when I'm starting to build something out.

As part-time indie hackers, we *need* to focus on what will get our products in front of customer and generating revenue. Revenue is the only metric that matters. Having the discipline to show up every day and not get distracted is only the first hurdle. As I'm tripping over it, there are others showing up.

### 2. Blocks

With project #2, I am blocked by Twitter API permissions. I'm in an endless email conversation with them trying to get permission to use their API.

Not sure what I'm doing wrong here but it looks like they need an exact use case, which I am not completely sure of yet!

This is honestly pissing me off more than anything because I am literally building the same exact thing other people have already built. I am unsure of what they need.

Working with APIs in general is a very annoying thing to do. They have endless permission lists and documentation on valid and invalid use cases. You are always worried you might be breaking some policy.

### 3. Speed

Like Ben in HTTOTW said, "there is no such thing as a slow-moving general". The problem with working on #120DayMBA is that other obligations take priority. I had family affairs last week. I had work in my 9-5. Speed is a crucial factor but it seems that speed comes with concentration and energy.

Really, there are two bottlenecks to speed— motivation and energy.

The good news is that both can be trained.

To solve the first bottleneck, work when you're motivated. Work when the idea is fresh in your mind and you're super excited to see it happen. Don't put too many artificial steps between what's in your mind and what comes out in the real world. Don't write a TODO list, block time out to do it, take a nap, think about it, write about it, then finally touch code. Just build the product! It's ok to pull all-nighters. It's ok to write something shabby and get it in front of people. It's not ok to dilute your motivation to do something over time.

To solve for the second bottleneck, find out why you don't have energy. Why are you tired a lot? It might be lack of sleep, being on your period, lack of vitamins, or too much food. Find out what you can do to bring your energy back up. Go on a run. Do 50 squats. Drink a lot of water. Eat less. If you're tired, just sleep. Don't look at Twitter or read something. Just stare at the ceiling and fall asleep.

Ask yourself how you're feeling periodically. Write it down.

Speed can be trained. Find out the bottlenecks and fix them.

### Marketing

Haven't done any. I know, this is stupid. I will start doing this more and more through Twitter and FB groups.

## Endnote

Sure, it looks like I'm facing a lot of stupid issues—a lot of them mainly from my broken work methods. But I still have hope that I will get one paying customer by the end of this month. I still have fifteen days. I know I can do it. I will post another report on the 22nd.

Wish me luck!
