Should I _really_ write every day? Is it better to write crap to fulfill a streak than it is to spend a lot of time curating a perfect article?

The old dilemma-- quality or quantity.

Perhaps, quality is just an excuse we give ourselves not to do the work.

For instance, today, I really don't know what to say. Everything I'm writing sounds horrible. What's the point????

Let's just skip today and start fresh tomorrow with more energy and thought. Tomorrow's post will be perfect :chef's kiss: :muah: ðŸ’‹

But I know that the dilemma is just an excuse. If I skip today, it's an empty spot in my tracker.

So here's my stupid post for my stupid streak ðŸ™„
