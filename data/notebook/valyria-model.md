![Viserys' model of Valyria](/postImages/valyria-model.webp)
In House of the Dragon, Viserys spends countless hours working on his stone model of Valyria. We see the model grow larger and more intricate throughout his life. 

My partner loves this model. It has no purpose.

It's just something he does.

We don't do enough of things that serve no purpose. I've lost touch of doing things just because I like doing them. I'm worried that as a result, I'll end up not liking doing anything.

I want this blog to be like Viserys' miniature Valyria-- serves no purpose but it's just something I do.
