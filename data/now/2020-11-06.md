## Some things I'm doing

- [ ] Front page for mojito moments with mdx support (can integrate CMS later)
- [ ] Document building the site with NextJS (go on twitch for this -- very helpful)
- [ ] Go on a run
- [x] Build SEO component for each blog post
- [ ] Add tracking ??
- [ ] Improve website load speed - [x] This could be done by, instead of filtering through each post in the directory to match, just use the value {date} as a path to mdx. There's no need to filter through the posts in the streaks folder --> Not a good idea bc I want bg color to be defined in each daily post - [ ] Optimize images correctly
- [x] Job interview with Hazel Analytics
