- [ ] Building Mojito Moments as a static website -- basic: no CMS or any dynamic parts
  - For the theme fonts, use Montserrat and Karla (Monteserrat for headings and Karla for the rest)
  - [x] Build the basic front page of the site. Looks alright. Need to add more colors and posts and fix descriptions
  - [ ] **Add the logo to top of page**
  - [ ] Add the dynamic "ask me anything" section
  - [ ] SEO all the posts and add tracking here
  - [ ] Don't do much until they give you material--> it's easy to set up the site but it's a waste of time without material
- [ ] **Automate investing in ETFs with Vanguard**
- [x] Reading Dune (!!!)
- [ ] Writing post --> "Switching my blog from Gatsby to NextJS"
- [ ] Personal blog additions
  - [ ] Maybe choose better icons for footer?
- [ ] Improve website load speed
  - [ ] There's still too much JavaScript running for the streaks page
- [ ] Habit tracker that shames you on your social media accounts when you break a streak. You pay when you don't want to be shamed --> do the basic layout and functionality (ppl can log in, add their habits to get shamed for)

Today was quite unproductive. I was feeling sick throughout the day. My backaches got worse and I slowly developed a headache.
