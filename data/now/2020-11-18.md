- [ ] [[Create a Python REST API using Flask]]
- [ ] Finish writing [[How I created a Newsletter with Buttondown and NextJS API Routes on Netlify]]

Today, I got a lot of the first bullet point working. I will be writing on it soon. It's not terribly hard to make an API when you're completely hopped up on coffee.

Rereadable things I read today:

- https://kitze.io/posts/gpt3-is-the-beginning-of-the-end
- https://kitze.io/posts/saddest-just-ship-it-story-ever

How do some people write so well?

Anyways, it's 1:07 am. I should be sleeping soon.
