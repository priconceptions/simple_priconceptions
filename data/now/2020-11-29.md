Today was pretty relaxed day. We went hiking and that pretty much took up most of my day. I'll need to head to bed soon because I will be up early tomorrow morning. I am going to focus on high output activities this week and track my time to see how I'm focusing. Downtime or times when I don't feel like working will be spent reading. I will only use social media if I am tweeting, writing, or collecting material. I hope to use this week in a much more mindful manner. Good ideas of any kind (tweets, posts, anything) will be listed haphazardly in list form in the daily writings that I do and later be revised on as I feel like it. It's important that I keep producing rather than consuming. My brain can only handle so much input.

Also, I'm thinking of coloring the boxes for the days in some order rather than arbitrarily assigning a color like I do right now.

Here is a possible color legend:

"green": productive (a lot of output)
"blue": productive not enough output days
"red": uneasy, too much input, not enough output
"pink": fun days
"black": dead soul days
"purple": days when something was accomplished (milestones, good things etc)

This is gonna be a bit hard but we'll see as time goes.
