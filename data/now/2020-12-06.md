## How today went

Today was a day for other plans. I spent a lot of time cleaning my basement and working on the chrome extension. I was really in the flow and didn't want to mess that up. The extension seems to be going places and I feel like I have a grip of things. It would definitely be a tool I would use A LOT if I made it so there's a huge win.

Today I am extremely grateful for the decision of visiting my grandma last year. The moments I spent with her, I'll never get back. I loved listening to stories of her as a young girl, getting married, having children, losing a brother. Nothing will compare. I wish I had the same time with my other grandparents but I am very thankful for spending so many amazing moments with her. I will always cherish them.
