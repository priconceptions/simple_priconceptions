## How today went

A lot of good things have been happening in the past few days although I haven't been posting here much. The chrome extension is going well and I will be starting a YouTube channel for some of the tutorials and writing blog posts on the video content. Notion has been a really good tool for all this. I love how unstructured Obsidian is but it's hard to track everything. Also copying templates from others is a total blessing. i just wish I could copy the markdown easily but I might be sourcing some of the content directly from Notion, which will solve this issue. I am makign a habit of doing things speedily without really worrying about the consequences much. Life is short. Tomorrow's a new day
