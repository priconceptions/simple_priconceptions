## Idea log

## How today went

Today was alright. Spending the day not working has been a blessing. I have been managing my life in Notion now. I'm off of Obsidian. The bi-directional links really is a game-changer for me. I use it a lot and my notes now look great. I feel like I'll be churning out more things soon. I just want the Notion API to come out as fast as possible. i would be amazing to use this as a CMS and directly connect my blog to these streaks. In any case, it shouldn't be too hard to just copy-paste it for now.

Don't have too much to say right now. I should be finishing up the YouTube script and some blog posts soon.

However, today, I've consumed a shit ton more than I ever should need to. The create list should be longer than the consume one. I should also really go on a run tomorrow.

Today I am grateful for tools like Notion that make navigating the internet a lot easier and streamlined. I am also grateful for the general direction of information becoming more and more free and accessible. The hard part now is managing and distilling all this information in a way that can be understood easily.
