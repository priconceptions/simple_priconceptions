## How today went

Today was good. Waking up early does wonders to help you feel in control of your day. The other thing I should definitely do is read more. I have been putting this off for a while. Also I should be a bit more cognizant of how I manage my energy. As it becomes evening, I become extremely tired. This might have to do with the lack of exercise. I will go on a run tomorrow at 3:30pm. Tomorrow, I will take a look at my work calendar and actually plan out my run schedule. It is a pity that I don't run or exercise as much as I used to. A couple of years ago, I was a beast. I was strong, determined, and fast. I just need to take it one day at a time. I should also start tracking my runs in a page or book like I used to to keep me honest. It really motivated my to avoid breaking a streak. Also, I should probably "end" my days earlierâ€”around 6:30 pmâ€” right before dinner. That was, I can actually enjoy the night.

Here are 10 content ideas:

1. Loss aversion â€” how it's a lot easier to get sad than it is to get happy
2. Glucose sensitivityâ€” how to decrease this and help the body regulate glucose naturally
3. Longevity on a micro scale â€” how regular people can make steps towards this
4. Stretching for women
5. The 100 day plan to build an audience
6. Impressions of SSC post on UBI
7. Life with "Is this on the test" syndrome
8. The benefits of shocking yourself regularly ("Born to Run" â†’ good to shock your body from time to time)
9. Review of "Last Color" movie
10. Getting used to thinking in exponentials (one beating the bid sad)

Today, I am grateful for the hot shower I took before writing this. It was the most wonderful feeling in the world. Yesterday, I fell down the stairs and slightly hurt my back. The shower made me feel like the most loved person in the whole world and like all my troubles were gone.
