## Idea log

## How today went

Ok so I have a brand new obsession. God why did I have to stumble upon this blog. it has ruined my nights and my mindfulness plans. Oh well. The morning went really well. I love not waking up straight into a zoom meeting. I think I have to stop restricting myself from laptop use in the mornings though. I can only write so much. I do love the practice of reading too, especially if it's an inspiring book. I feel like today was one of those ultra-work days. I got a lot of things done, though not in my personal life. Also, I'm having a hard time sticking to the evening wrap up schedule. I know it'll make me feel better about wasting my nights but yeah.

Anyways, here are 10 tweet ideas:

- Loss Aversion - why it's easier to be sad than happy
- Applying exponential thinking to your life
- Why running is meditation
- The best products I bought last year
- Big data threads â€” why data is so big etc
- Products I want â€” wishlist
- On life-long learning (what to learn, how to not forget stuff you learned before, continuously learning new things)
- Ways to grow an audience on Twitter in X days (100 days or something) â†’ something I want to know too
- Useful frameworks to think about the world
- Mindful device usage

Today, I am grateful for my house. I love the carpet and it's the most cozy, safe place in the world.
