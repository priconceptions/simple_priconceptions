## Idea log

- 30 mins 30 days anki

## How today went

I feel a severe lack of time nowadays. It might have to do with work right now but time really seems to be slipping away. I probably just need patience and not hope to get everything I hoped to get done in the week. Rather, I should take a longer timeframe approach— around 30 days and really track and measure progress. I did Anki today after a while and it was the first day I finished all the cards in my deck. It was a great feeling. However, I do need to add cards everyday as I'm learning new things. I should also set aside serious study time — an hour everyday at least when I study/read/learn new things and add to my anki deck.

Another thing I've been skimping on is running. I am losing muscle at a severe rate and I'm not even sure if I'll get it back. However, now's the time to really make this a habit.

Here are some app ideas:

1. Atomic Habits based app — input goals, measure, and track them
2. The integrated app for diabetic people
3. An app that matches your outfit style with clothing stores and particular styles of clothing
4. Female erotica app
5. Movie for the night app
6. An app that curates diabetic friendly restaurant options for people
7. An SRS app for learning blockchain concepts
8. An app that tells people what to learn/study next based on trending topics on twitter
9. An app where companies can bid on writers
10. An app that picks up on trends and tells you what to build

Today, I am grateful for my health. Being in good health is one of those things you don't think about until the smallest inconvenience. I am grateful that I can run around and physically shape myself however I want.
