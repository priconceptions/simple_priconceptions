## How today went

Today was kinda stressful and annoying. I didn't wake up early and that threw me off a bit. Also my mind was racing all day, which was really distracting. Pomodoro really helps me focus on my tasks and I will stick to it more rigidly from tomorrow. I always wonder if what I'm doing is the right direction. But I think I might be overoptimizing on direction and not giving any attention to my execution. It's really about asking what I can do today or in the next hour to get closer to my goals than asking what I can do tomorrow or sometime in the week. I'm living too much in the futture and not enough in the present, which is a shame, given how much I could actually do if I focused on the most high impact thing I could do in the next 25 minutes rather than where am I heading in Friday or something.

I need to relax and jsut do things. Even if stuff doesn't work out or I quit, I'll regret not starting rather than doing something and "embarassing myself". Today was a high input day and not enough of an output day.

Here are 10 article ideas:

1. Menu dependence and using this for good
2. How to get the important but not urgent things done everyday
3. Why do we spend so much time worrying about people
4. We give all our love to others but none to ourselves
   1. Why people are good at evaluating their own lives as a third part
5. Stop having so many regrets
6. Make more mistakes — become the man in the arena
7. Financial independence for women
8. Running a marathon is easier than running a sprint—philosophical tenets of a deep life
9. You are the average of the 20 people you tweet with
10. Big data can make everything cheap

Today I am grateful for Twitter. Small things seem to make a huge difference in my life there. I am grateful for the people who just want a better world and are fulyl committed to make that happen. I want to be more like them.
