## Idea log

## How today went

Overall, today was a good day. Got out of a sticky situation with a problem. I'm working through it right now. Other than that, not sure why, but I have a weird bittersweet feeling of being old. I'm not terribly old but I'm old enough that my life is in my hands and really no one _really_ cares about me in that sense. I feel like I need to build some discipline in my life and do things a lot faster. There are people my age who have kids and are thinking about how to provide for them and I have the privilege of not thinking about that right now. I'm not sure what it is but I'm feeling like I really need to hunker down and do things I want to do. I need to be more open about thinking about the future because the future seems much closer than it did in the past.

Anyways, here are 10 daily habits I should do to improve my discipline:

1. sleep early
2. wake up at the same time
3. do "road work" → go on runs/walks
4. fast every week
5. Have the same morning routine
   1. Write
   2. Study
   3. Build
   4. Run
6. Anki for 25 mins
7. Read for an hour
8. Spend no more than 30 mins on my phone (except for zoom)
9. Ship one thing
10. Reflect

Today I am grateful for my house and my family, who always encouraged me to be financially independent and secure. They instilled very good spending habits in me from a young age so that saving is my default behavior.
