## Idea log

## How today went

Today was good. I got a lot of things done. I think this pomodor thing really helps imporve my speed in doing things. It's a great practice to continue doing. Being on a timeline kinda sucks and it's really important to keep your goals in front of you and keep yourslef accountable to them. I really need to make a habit of waking up early and doing things that are important but not urgent in the morning. Also, I should restart my running habit. It's getting bad an I'm kinda getting out of shape.

I had a meeting with an Ultraspeaking coack today. One thing that was partciularly interesting was that I spoke about how you should work on growing your booty in the new age and was dicussing how this could be bad thing to talk about with someone "important". We had a long conversation about caring abotu what other people think and living life so you're accountable to yourself. The whole session was more like therapy.

Anyways, tomorroe, I need to practice speed further.

Here are 10 physical products:

1. Crop tops (piscataways)
2. Scarves with custom art work
3. Journals to track habits and goals
4. Notebooks to learn some particualr subject
5. Ethnic earrings
6. Custom rings
7. Plants
8. Shelves that are in-built
9. custom wallets
10. Custom notebooks

Today I am grateful for my health. I am grateful that I am able to carry 100 pounds without completely dying.
