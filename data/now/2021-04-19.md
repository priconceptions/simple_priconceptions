## Idea log

## How today went

Today, I was really thinking about that story of the guy in Turkey who lit himself on fire when a corrupt poicewoman demanded a bribe. Especially that saying--"sometimes you need to set yourself on fire to shed light on the situation". I feel like I was dealing with some annoyingly incompetent people today and it kind of ruined my day. But overall, things eem to be in control.

I got a lot done too. I think that notecard to do list method works. It feels really nice to cross thing soff physically. And doing things really adds momentum to do more and more.

I hope I can keep up this moemtnum.
