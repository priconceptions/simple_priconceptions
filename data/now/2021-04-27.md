## How today went

Today was good enough. Like a lot of days these days, unless I get stuff done in the morning, there is no way the stuff will get done in any other time of the day. Afternoons are the worst for me. I absolutely cannot get myself to do anything. I can't even take naps on occasion, which really sucks.

Work has been weird too. I keep gettin anxious about the randomest things. And having no one to help--who's on my level-- is especially distressing. I dont know what it is but I really want to escape this. This whole thing serves as additional motivation to keep building things and build an audience to become an island in a way.

I am too forgiving with my time. I need to track what I am doing and really get to the bottom of things. I should especially use help from outside and learn to delegate my work and take my time seriously.

I get really motivating thoughts at times. What if I could pay off all my debts by next year. In one year, what if I can acheive 15 years of paying off things? I think it could actually happen. I have made crazier things happen in the past.

Just take what you're doing a lot more seriously. Don't waste time on sad thoughts and anxiety. Get your shit together and be happy once it's the afternoon. Just take a nap or something and don't worry about not being productive all the time. You can decide to be happy.. to be a badass.

Today's a good day and I'm lucky to be alive and have such a great support system around me. Screw the rest.
