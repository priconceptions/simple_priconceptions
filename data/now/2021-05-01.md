## How today went

Today went well. It was the first day of the month so spirits were high. I'm trying to sustain this enthusiasm till the end of the month. Planning out all the stuff to do in detail helps me realize that a lot of things I want to do are actually acheivable.

One of the lessions from today is that you should ask for help faster than you think. If you try something 3 times and it doesn't work, ask for help.

Another lesson-- don't go get groceries on an empty stomach. Everything looks good and extremely tasty to a hungry person. Also, being hungry and shopping leads to fighting. So nope.

Today, I am grateful for my car. I am grateful that I had the capacity to learn stick fast and this amazing car now takes me wherever I want to go. It's an awesome, tiny car with good mileage too.
