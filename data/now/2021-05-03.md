## How today went

Work really sucks the happiness out of me. Stepping into work in the morning is like putting my mouth in the face of a dementor. It just fucking sucks. It is my main mission right now to get a new job. A job that is less stressful, with more young people, and more friends. The kind of work I am doing right now and the way I am feeling mentally is absolutely unacceptable.

The one thing to realize is that your mental health is your responsibility. No one will come to you and pull you out of the ditch you've dug yourslef into. It is up to you to determine your fate and your happiness and put draw boundaries on what's acceptable and what's not.

Especially as a woman, one thing I've notices is that I always think-- is it just me? Am I being weak? But no! Your feelings should matter to you. They will never matter to anyone else and everyone else will keep treating you like a machine if you let them. They'll keep feeding you new things and beat you if you make a mistake. So, it's up to you to trust yourself. It's up to you to trust your feelings and realize that if you're feeling bad, then things ARE fucking bad.

So, climb out of that hole. Use your strength. And emerge stronger. You can only climb mountains once you're above ground.

Anyways, this was a long post to say, I am climbing out of my hole. I can feel it happening. It'll take a bit of time though.

Today, I saw my mom send my dad my birthday text to my dad to proofread. My heart felt so warm seeing that. She is the cutest. I am grateful for my mom today--for being the sweetest, most caring, more flexible person ever.
