### Chakraui Menu and Popover not closing??
https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/3967
On the same boat with `<Modal>`.

Workaround was to `yarn remove framer-motion` and `yarn add framer-motion@4.1.11`.

## How today went

A lot of today was spent being crazy about Pomofam. It's not a bad thing. I think humans are built this way. When you get excited about somehting, you should'nt restrict yourself from pursuing that thing. Humans are meant to pounce on opportunities. What's sad is that all this was at the expense of other things on my list. But, it's fine. Not a big deal.

I want to start a channel- PriyANKI and give people ANKI cards to study programming. Interviewing is a bitch. You think you're good but the pressure of other eyeballs on your code makes you feel crazy. Things that are obvious are foreign.

PriyANKI will have an associated Instagram account with nice graphics about prograaming concepts. It will be a nice thign to have my face out there.

Anyways, today went well. I felt good working on Pomofam and was super excited by it. It will be a cool project.

I don't have much else to say. I also want to run everyday. But I only have like 13 hours awake and 8 of those are taken up by work. It's no excuse though. I can spare an hour.

I just want to see progress. I had this running log that I kept going for months. I could actually see the progress I was making and it felt so good. I need to do that more. The monthly habit tracker is great too.

Today, I am grateful for my bf. Idk why he likes me sometimes but I'm happy he does. He's an amazing person.
