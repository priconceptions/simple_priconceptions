## Idea log

## How today went

Today was good. I felt good and did a lot of things. Published a post after like forever. I'm being less preious with my blog and increasing the posst rate most of all. People need to find me and a good way to hit gold is to keep blogging and giving people valuable insights. I don't need to start all the way at the beginning. Just post what you learn everyday. It doesn't need to be essay length. Even small posts are valuable.

I also keep getting rejected from jobs. I mean I don't care. It just sucks that I put in the time and I mess up one thing and suddenly I'm deemed an idiot. Whatever, the next job should be interview-less. I cannot keep interviewing and putting in wasted hours for them to just be like "aight bye". I know my worth. I know I can do things. I don't need some person to tell me otherwise.

Anyways, I'm doing well with Friday Financials too. I need to be on top of things like these more. Also, start reading physical books about great people. Read stories. I'm tried of non-fiction.

Today, I am grateful for my family. I don't know how they do things but they do and they keep us happy.
