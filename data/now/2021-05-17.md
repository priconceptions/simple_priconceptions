- What is the difference between function () {} and () => {} in JS

```jsx
const Stacy2 = {
  name: 'Stacy',
  address: 'Los Angeles, California',
  ssn: 1234,
  hobbies: ['knits', 'dances', 'reads', 'runs'],
  eats: function () {
    return `${this.name} is eating`;
  },
  sleeps: function () {
    return `${this.name} is sleeping`;
  },
  wakesUp: function () {
    return `${this.name} is waking up`;
  },
  revealsHobbies: function () {
    return `${this.name}'s hobbies are ${this.hobbies.join(', ')}`;
  }
};
```

This doesnt work??

```jsx
const Stacy2 = {
  name: 'Stacy',
  address: 'Los Angeles, California',
  ssn: 1234,
  hobbies: ['knits', 'dances', 'reads', 'runs'],
  eats: () => {
    return `${this.name} is eating`;
  },
  sleeps: () => {
    return `${this.name} is sleeping`;
  },
  wakesUp: () => {
    return `${this.name} is waking up`;
  },
  revealsHobbies: () => {
    return `${this.name}'s hobbies are ${this.hobbies.join(', ')}`;
  }
};
```

## How today went

Today was good. Super tired. I ran after ages today and my thighs feel super stiff. I couldnt wake up early because of this. But tomorrow, I need to be more serious about waking up and doing things.

Also, I need to be more serious about sharing stuff online. It's a fun thing to do and treat it like this. Instead of burning your eyes through your twitter feed, this is a better, more happy use of time. Think about what makes your thing/product unique and showcase it to the world.

Also, thinking about https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game?ck_subscriber_id=1177574387&utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=A+new+science%20-%205866730 a lot. It's the people who give without an expectation of return that win in the internet age. You need to give things of high quality without expecting money or anything in return. The returns will come. This is a very hindu philosphy.

Also thinking about the baker's dozen. Normal dozen=12. Baker's dozen=13. How can you give people more than they expect?

In any case, today was good. I am grateful for the women in my family today. They endure so much, asking for nothing in return.
