## How today went

To be honest, today sucked. I am not proud of myslef for today. I woke up late and that completely threw me off. I did some things at work but overall, it was a super low-energy day. I need to understand what is causing this. What makes me so low energy?

I think it might have to do with a couple of things... staring at screens for too long. Listening to stuff too much. And most of all, a somewhat lack of belief in myself. A feeling that I will never do amazing things and not internalizing the baker's dozen personality. Give 110% in everything you do. Or just don't do it at all. Relax. Read a book.

I think I have become used to being average. I remember when I wasn't like this. There was an expectation that I was intelligent and I was awesome. Now, I think my brain has become used to coasting. I need to get back into the habit of expecting the best work out of myself at all times.

Stop thinking of yourslef as average. Give your best at every situation and be happy. Put a smile on your face at all times. No frowning. Tbh, I think the more I smile, the better my work will be and the better my day will be.

So, the focus for tomorrow is to smile all the time. Also, to work fast. Make sure to get everything you need to get done tomorrow (at work). WIth your projects, work fast. Race against yourself and make speed a habit.

1. speed
2. baker's dozen
3. smile!

Today, I am grateful for my Dad. He is such a good influence on me and my sister and has done the utmost to keep our family happy and safe.
