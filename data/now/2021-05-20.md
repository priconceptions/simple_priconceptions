## Idea log

## How today went

Worked a lot at work. Didn't work as much on my own projects. Kinda tired today tbh. Music does a lot to make me happy and work faster.

I feel like a lot of stress and sadness is self-inflicted. Why would people inflict stress on themselves? Maybe they think it makes them seem more serious and mysterious. In any case, I think it's a lot better to have a light attitude to situations. Things are definitely not as bad as they seem most of the time. We just need to chill
