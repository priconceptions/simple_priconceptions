## How today went

Today went well. There was a lot of flaring tensions yesterday. I read Meditations and took a nap an felt a lot better. Today went a lot better. I felt happy about some decisions I made.

Overall, today was a peaceful day. I slept well and felt happy. Not too much input. Not too much output. Just normal.

Yesterday was a shit storm. But some stoic philosphy fixed that and made me feel so much better and centered me.

Today I am grateful for my support system. The fact that I have good people around me and I don't need to be worried about being cheated at every move. The world seems good today.
