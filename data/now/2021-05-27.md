## Idea log


## How today went

Lots of consuming today and a lot of brain fog. I woke up super tired and moved super slowlyyyy. Even now, I'm feeling extremely slow and tired. I think I need to stick to the daily habits more rigidly even when I get thrown off. For eg, running in the morning will help me feel less fat and sstretching every morning will help my body stay loose.

The heat is getting to me that's it. I am going to paint my house this weekend. I'll need to spackle up all the holes and sand it and wait for it to dry. Just concerned that I fall and break my back when I paint the high parts. Oh well, you live and learn. Nothign will happen. Just keep going. I'm actually super excited to paint it. 

I should start my own list... things I learned I'm allowed to do. For eg
- paint my house an ugly color
- ask people to do their jobs
- grow a lot of plants in my house
- cold call people and ask if they want help
- fail at projects
- create ugly products
- cheer people on when theyre running
- say "hello" and smile at everyone I pass by on my walks
- sell hand-written notes and cheat sheets
- tweet everyday

Anyways, it would be cool. 

Today, I am grateful that I am in a position to be free and do bold stuff. I couldn't have done this if I was in some other country. It's great being in the US
