## Idea log


## How today went
It's the first day of the month-- which means today is a blank sheet. All the stuff from last month is erased. I discovered Ikigai on Jakob Greenfeld's blog and instantly bought it. It's an awesome book. It's making me feel guilty about all the time Im wasting and my inability to think big. Why am I wasting so much time?

I will experiment this moht using the excel sheets. I feel like if I religiously follow through, I will get a lot more important things done and my mind will be clear. 

What's interesting is that I didn't go on Twitter or Instagram today. I was totally immersed in this book.

The thing is that I often look for a saving grace. Something that will rescue me from my apathy. But that thing won't ever exist. You need to practive your values every single day-- especially the days that are hard. 

I need to plan for the new month. June is a good month. I also will take days off at the end of this month and really focus on what needs to be done and relax a bit.

Today, I am grateful for my mom and dad. They have been my backbone for everything.
