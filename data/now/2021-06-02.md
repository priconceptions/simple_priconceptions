## Idea log
 - a month is a long time. What can I do to make my life better this month?

## How today went
A lot of work was done at work today. For my personal goals, I worked on the monthly debrief. It was a good exercise. I still need to complete it but it put my wants into perspective. I need to document my life a lot more. What I'm doing. My time, my energy, my mood. Tracking will help me improve. One of my goals this month is to reflect on my day everyday and think about what I've done and document my life. Next month, I will know exactly how each day was. Also after a while, i think I'll get tired of writing I haven't done much today.

Today I am grateful for Sebastian for all these awesome tools. I am thankful that Jakob Greenfeld introduced me to his writing. I love all these tools and I think theyll help me live fuller days.
