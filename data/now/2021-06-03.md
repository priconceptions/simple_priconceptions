## Idea log


## How today went

This morning was great. I atually did a lot. I really love the work cycles thing. Sebastian has a treasure trove of writing that I jsut discovered Even thoug these articles are like 12 years old, they're really applicable. I love how rigid they are and not like the magical fluff other people write like "believe in yourself" and "work hard". They are good, rigid practices that he has done and that have worked.

After the morning, I kinda got lazy. After an initial amount of work, I just didn't feel like doing anything. Really just wanted to chill. I read more of Ikigai and mor eof Sebastian's blog but I was mostly wasting time and not putting in my full attention into these actvities. I should've taken a nap instead. What I've noticed is that music really helps in this sort of situation. Tbh I didn't have much to do at work so I was bored and spent a lot of time half-reading--- which.. admittedly is bad.

What I will do next time is try to learn DEFi or watch some videos on DEFi and take notes. If I really don't feel like doing any of this, I'll just sleep and wake up refreshed. 

I finished a lot of Meme Lordz today in only 3 work cycles. I think I could finish the whole thing if I worked for longer. I was addicted to working on it.

Anyways, the thing for tomorrow is to not be complacent after working hard in the morning. It is to continue reading or learning. If you're too tired, just take a nap or stare at the wall. Don't do half-work.

Today, i am thankful for the beautiful weather we're having. I really like how it's feeling rn. Also grateful for having my parents with me.
