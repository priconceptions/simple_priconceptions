## Idea log


## How today went
Super tired rn. It's already late. But today, I feel free. I feel free ot do whatever the hell I want. I don't feel chained to anything or anybody. It's a sobering feeling but I think it's better this way. 

I need to make it a habit to work more. I read so much online and engage in such neurotic activities. All activities I do must be chosen by *me*. I shouldn't let dumb things choose my time. Time is an expense. 

Today I am grateful for how I'm raised and how I want to improve. It's something that needs to be ingrained in you that you should be reliable and not blame others for your problems. I am grateful that my family has made it a habit to clean, make my bed, and keep my promises.
