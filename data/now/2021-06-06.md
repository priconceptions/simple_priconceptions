## How today went

Did a lot of errands today. Nothing much else. Pretty much spent the whole day outside. It was hot af today and I spent every second of today sweating. It was annoying. 

But overall, it was fun buying new things. Now I'm tired thoug, so I'll sleep.

I'm grateful for my car today. it gives me so much freedom.
