## How today went

Today was a lot more input than I would like. the heat is really annoying. I don't know. These days, I can't pay attention to anything and Im noticing that I'm expecially prone to eating a lot. I don't like it. 

Also, I'm losing control og my time, I am being a lot more ok with my time going to waste, which I hate. I  need better systems with time tracking and goal setting.

ANyways, bought a bedframe today and I'm happy about that.

It's already late. Im going to sleep. I am grateful for cold showers today.
