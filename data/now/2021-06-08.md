## Idea log


## How today went
Today went alright. Was kind of tired and in an emtional state. I really need to do the things I set my mind to. It has been too long since I've been making false promises to myself. The time has come to take want I want seriously and acti upon my wishes.

Practicing typing has made me super hyper aware of how I type. It's really annoying. Also can't find much to say today for right now. 

I think the time tracker will help me spend my time better.

Today, I am thankful for the safety of my situation and good books like Ikigai.
