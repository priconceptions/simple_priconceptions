## Idea log


## How today went
Today was very tiring. I don't know what it was but I took like 2 naps. Still wasnt completely ok. Even in the mornings, the work cycles were'nt great. Not sure what it was but I was tired. I also spent a lot of time on Twitter and all. Not a good thing. 

Anyways, tomorrow will be better I hope.
