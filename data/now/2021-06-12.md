## How today went
Man spent a lot of money today. All necessary things from IKEA. IKEA is crack. Things are sooo cheap and everything is arranged in a way that you want to buy things. You experience each room like it's your own house and you wanna buy everything. And before you  know it, you've spent all your money. Anyways, bought a mattress and some essential house stuff. Now, super tired. We're going tomorrow to assemble the bed.
