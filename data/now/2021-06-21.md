## How today went
Today was fun. Spent a lot of time hanging out with bf. We went to get clothes and then pizza. It was great. Also showed the house to some people. I feel like my goals are slipping away from me. I am in a slump and I'm distacted by all this house stuff. What I need rn is a routine. I don't wanna keep doing this. I need this slump to pass. I just need to ficus on doing the basic things that keep me sane. 

I will wake up early and define what to do tomorrow. Today I am thankful for algorithm gods.
