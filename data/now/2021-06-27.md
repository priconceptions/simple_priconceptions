## How today went

Got a lot of work for the house done today. Nothing much other than that. I am exhauseted right now. Not sure how I'll actually work tomorrow. I really need to define my life in a way where I don't need to work if I don't want to and the work that I'm doing is actually interesting to me.

For now I am overwhlmed with work with the house. It seems never ending. But I guess that's the costs of living alone. I should also force myslef to not use my phone during transition moments. You know, jsut chill

Today I am grateful for my family, who help me and understand me
