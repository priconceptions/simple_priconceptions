## Idea log


## How today went
Tiring. Super tired right now. Not used to mowing and all but I guess you live and you learn. Back at parent's house right now. The biggest thing is making timeto work on my side projects and not just winging my dreams. I need to take my life seriously or else no one else will. 

The one thing I want to do this month is to wake up everyday at 6am, regardless of when I slept the previous night. I can take a nap in the afternoon or something but to set a pattern to wake up early every single day.

I will be tracking wake up time in the next entries.

Today I am grateful for some friends. They have been in my life forever and are great people overall.
