## How today went

Today was a rest and recover day. I was super tired and couldn't pay attention to any one thing. I slept a lot and ate a lot. I wonder how to curb the hunger urges especially when you're around period time. I don't want to do it with more drugs or anything. I wonder what in my environment I need to change. Most of all, I probably need to stop switching houses. I'm just kinda annoyed how dejected and low energy I get.
