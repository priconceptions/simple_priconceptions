## Idea log


## How today went
Today was good. Specifically, the first 4 hours. After that, like a gateway drug, the first 5 mins of Twitter turned into 4 hours. It truly is like the broken window theory. Once you start, there is no way to stop it. It is better to just turn off your phone and all social media until a lot later and spend the rest of the time working or studying. And even if you do go on social media, strictly make it less than 5 mins. Tbh, this doesn't work. The allure is strong. Once you break you good habits streak, it's extremely exhausting to get back on track.

Tomorrow, plan your day beforehand. Don't leave anything to chance. If you want to post on Twitter, go to that Notion page instead of Twitter. If you want to write, open a blank page.

Anyways, tomorrow will be better. I am grateful for the rain. It was hot af before that.
