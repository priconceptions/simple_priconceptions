- Notes from time tracking: A lot of meetings today. Accoording to the time tracking sheet, I did well today. But now, I feel like not well enough. It's ok. Try to avoid meetings.

## Idea log


## How today went
Today went well. From my time tracking, I did well but I don't think I've done enough. It's weird, I can never be happy, especially because I see so many others being successful and happy online. The answer isn't to stop looking at social media... actually maybe it is a bit. The answer, overall is to expect more of my time. To go intense and produce more valuable things.

I am thinking of whether I should spend money on the software ideas newsletter...should I spend money to let someone else do the market research for me? I don't know... it seems like money well spent. But it isn't a small amount either. It's $57! I don'tt know. Maybe just YOLO into this too. If I have even a small potential of making a steady source of income, it is totally worth it. If I can make $100 online from this $57 investment, it is worth it.

Let's see. Just YOLO into it and see what happens. But if you do YOLO into it, you won't spend more time browsing ideas or some other strategies online. You will sit down, delete Twitter or Instagram and not read another newsletter and just work at making money. Nothing else. I feel like this isn't a bad thing.

Just YOLO into it and buy the newsletter. And stick to above commitment. Deep work for 3 months. If I make $100, then I made a good decision. If not, i dont know. Invest more money in Bitcoin I guess.

Anyways, today went well enough but there's more ways to improve tomorrow.

Today, I am grateful for the society we live in today. I am more or less equal to anyone else.
