## How today went

I can't stick to a schedule and that's what's bothering me today. I'll do all the planning and all but I just cant seem to stick to time blocks and get things I want done.  I think I need a purge to clean out everything that's distracting me and get my attention back.

I need to take my shit seriously or it wont happen.
