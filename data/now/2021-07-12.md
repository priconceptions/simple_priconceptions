## Idea log


## How today went

There was a lot more input that I wanted. I just read and read and read and read. And nothing much more. I don't like this. Do something. Either do work or do extra stuff. Don't just feel guilty and keep reading. Youre being super wasteful of your time. I dont know. Some things on the interenet is so good, it's hard to resist.

I need to actually get into a routine. Not just do whatever I feel like at the moment. It's really necessary to be strict with myself otherwise I'll just keep doing dumb shit and waste my time.

Today I am grateful for my family, whose absense I'm sort of feeling right now. It will take some time to get used to living alone.
