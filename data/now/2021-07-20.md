## How today went

I spent too much time on dumb things. I couldv'e done what I had to in 10 minutes and asked questions. Instead I was doing unnecessary work. I need to fix this. Do the bare minimum and try to finish things ASAP.

Anyways, today I am grateful for my bf--who's more a good friend to me than anything.
