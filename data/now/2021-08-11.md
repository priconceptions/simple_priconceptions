## How did today go?

- Did you take the easiest route to your goals? - Yes. I got a lot of my list done today. Almost all the things are checked off, which is great.

Today, I was at home alone and felt like I heard some noises. I swear it was scary. I legit thought someone was climbing up my stairs. So, I called the police to check it out. I held onto my phone, looking around the house hoping it's nothing but also thinking of ways to justify my calling them if (most likely) the noise was nothing.

They came. They checked the house. It was nothing. It is a safe place but for a hot sec I was scared. Even if it was nothing, my feeling wasn't stupid. I had these emotions because I thought there was a threat.

Stop thinking your emotions and instincts are stupid. It's a lot better to look paranoid for a second than regret.

Anyways, today I am thnakful for structures in society like the police. Where else is it so easy to call someone for help?
