## How did today go?
- Did you take the easiest route to your goals?

Super tired today. I got a lot of stuff for work done but nothing for my own growth, which was expected. It's ok. Tomorrow, I'll owrk more on my stuff and actually launch stuff. 

Work was good too. We talked a lot about salaries and what's next. Also joked around a lot. I stocked up on a bunch of snacks and feel super fat.

Today went well overall. I am thankful for days like this.
