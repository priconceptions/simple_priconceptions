## How did today go?
- Did you take the easiest route to your goals?

Not sure. Somewhat. I did keep telling myself to go faster and faster but some things just required more thinking and understandign what's happening. For example, creating the cards for affordabelshit is still not done because I just cant get it to work properly. Oh well, I'll try again.

Focusmate is such an awesome thing btw! I got so much done because of that. I should schedule these every day. At least one session every day. That's all I need to do well. I'l schedule one tomorrow for 6:30 am.

Anyways, today was good. Gonna sleep now. I am grateful for cheap TV and the fact that I can listen to Kannada at a foreign country.
