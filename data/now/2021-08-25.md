## Idea log
>_"When you’re a kid the first thing you want martial arts to help with is breaking shit. You want to set up planks and bricks and bust them in two with karate chops. So I was heartened when in the first lessons the master said there was a simple technique behind the breaking of objects. Don’t aim for the target. Aim beyond it. Because the master said if you aim for the surface, your fist will stop there. If you aim behind, it will keep travelling through. And it’s true._

>_When I started taking my book seriously, I had to find a way to think of the job...The aiming point had to be beyond the target, so its pressure load spread over a wider area. I had to not only commit to finishing a full length novel. Better still I had to think of a novel as a beginning. it would be a trilogy of novels. It made the first effort an opening gambit._

>_It no longer mattered if the work was going to be an immovable object. I was punching through it or breaking myself in the attempt. As for whether to conceive of the job as hard or easy, it meant I did neither. I didn’t need that. It just needed doing."_

## How did today go?
- Did you take the easiest route to your goals?

Today was a lot more thinking and reading shit online than actually doing anything. i did wake up early and go to a focusmate session and tried coming us with a design but just thought of the architecture and ended up going to NextJS with Supabase-- something I know pretty well.

I need to focus on actually doing shit faster and not worrying too much about problems that dont exist yet. It's better to have 10 shitty completed products than just the landing page of 5 projects. 

Anyways, today's interview was interesting. It left me wondering if I sound passive by default. Is my voice just always sounding like I'm a doormat? It made me question if I even wanted to work at this company because of how crazy everything seemed. Also really not down to go into the office 3 days a week. It's better to go in once a week for an hour than 3 times 30 minutes. Let's see. If anything, this is talking practice.

I am grateful for my body. I put it through a lot and I'm still fine.
