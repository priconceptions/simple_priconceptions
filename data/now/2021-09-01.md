## How did today go?
- Did you take the easiest route to your goals?

Super tired at this point and nothing much to say. So, I'll leave with things I am thankful for. I am thankful that my house sisn't flood. I am thankful for devices like the pump. It is raining a lot. I am also thankful for good food and recipes online.
