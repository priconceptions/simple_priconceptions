## How did today go?
- Did you take the easiest route to your goals?

I was super tired in the mornings and evening but I did get some work done. It went well. I need to find a way to be energetic mostly. I am in a state of tiredness and lethargy for a lot of the time. Not sure what to do. I definitley need to exercise more often. And sleep more. And stretch. These are all things I tell myself I should do but never actually do. I need to schedule time for this too I guess. I don't know... in the time of actually doing it, I feel super tbored. I'd rather just skip than do it.


I just need to make this a habit. And skip the decision making.

ANywyas, today I am thankful that the pump in the basement started working and the water was pumped out mstly. Also for my parents who worked so hard on this.
