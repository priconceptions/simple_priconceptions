## How did today go?
- Did you take the easiest route to your goals?

Alright. Overall, I was becoming more and more sick with work. I need to find something more itneresting to do. I need to get out of this and build projects on the side and make this a priority. It isn't enought o just work. It's really important to do things on the side for your personal developement and to join remote companies. I just know for sure I don't want to work in a place that can so easily mandate me to come to the office.

And yes, this is a big deal to me. The more I work remotely, the more time I have for my sanity. I need ot make my developement a priority and document thigns I am learning publicly.

Anyways, I am going in to the office tomorrow and coming back around 4 pm. I will log in later in the evening. I am even wondering if this is a good idea. I am concerned that I won't be able to leave easily. But, let's see how I feel tomorrow morning and I can jsut say I have an appointment or something.

Today, I am grateful for how cozy my bed is and how I am comfortable. Like is good even though it can feel tiring sometimes. I am grateful for my health, my youth, and the opportunities I have.
