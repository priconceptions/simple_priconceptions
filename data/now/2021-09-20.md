## How did today go?
- Did you take the easiest route to your goals?

Today wasn't great. Overall, I was tired. I couldn't really work on the logic for the fork. I just could not figure it out and draw it out logically. I really needed to break the steps down. I think this will be my hardest step. After this thing, everything else should be easier.

I was also bogged with the css shit. Like I think bootstrap looks butt ugly but I don't want to spend time working on css or learning other CSS frameworks. TBH, chakraui looks trash too and I spend more time fiddling with it. I just need to stop worrying about this and just stay focused on finishing and shipping it.

I also went to the gym and did a good workout.

Today I am grateful for my comfort and how easy my life is compared so many others'.
