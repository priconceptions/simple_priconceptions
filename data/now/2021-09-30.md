## Things I've done today

### [[Interstitial]]
- 15:02: feeling super tired. like i need a nap. not feeling like doing any work. overall just wamt to find something else. i am trying to email back the interviewers from Monday but not sure if it will even go through. maybe just try to do so right now with the firstName.lastName@flatiron format. just do it
- 20:41: alright, got reejcted from flatiron. That's ok. I will go where God is willing. Anyways, I seem to have gotten the fork logic of the tictactoe game-- which is definietly the hardest step. I should finish this by tomorrow. SOme things on my mind rn:
	- start an agency--- make money fast through side projects. 
	- prioritize remote jobs over other ones
	- get another 3 lunch meal prep boxes at Marshalls
	I feel dizzy rn actually. Kinda hungry. gonna eat now
	- become fucking amazing at talking. Overtalk. Overcommunicate. You will be a lot better
	- ask S for security deposit and rent
