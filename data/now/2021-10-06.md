## How did today go?

- Did you take the easiest route to your goals?

Today was good. I went to Manhattan to get lunch with a manager. It was kinda chaotic to be honest. I got up at 5:15 and left the hosue at 5:45. My intention was to arrive at JC by 6:45 and then spend 50 minutes to get to Manhattan by 8 am for a meeting. I came to the office at 6:45 and decided to take a short nap till 7:00. I woke up, ready to leave and checked to see the meeting had moved to 9 am. OK.. so I stayed to take this meeting but then it got moved to 9:30. Eventually left the office at 10:30 and came to manhattan at 11:20. WOrked out but it was chaotic as fuck.

Well, don't give that much of a fuck about meetings again. It sucks trying to cater to their needs. Anyways, shit happened. Now I'm home.

Also I was happy I finished the web dev anki cards. I need to do them tomorrow too. Also, revise the DS and algo cards and make them better.
