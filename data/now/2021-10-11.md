## How did today go?

Today was ok. Like I attempted to do a lot of things but didn't axtually get a lot of things done. I dont know. Kind ahvaing weird feelings about stuff. I fel especially dark after hearing about my friend's dad. I don't know. Stuff seems so impermanent these days. What am I even heading towards. Where am I going?

I don't see myself doing anything specific in 5 years. jsut see myslef super rich. Is this a bad thing? I have a lot to think about.

Anyways, grateful for the people around me.
