## How did today go?

- Did you take the easiest route to your goals?

Having a super hard time sleeping early these days. But, it's not the worst thing in the world. Stop making excuses. What is life but a beautiful struggle? I don't know... it's late af to do anything right now. It's probably a good idea to do these when work end at 5 pm and evaluate the day from 5pm to 5pm. I don't get to do these right when I do these this late.

I need to wake up at 8am tomorrow. I hope I do wake up.

I am grateful for my life. For my bf. I have a great life and a lot of potential to do so mcuh more.
