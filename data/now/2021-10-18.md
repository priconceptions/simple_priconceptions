## Things I've done today

### [[Interstitial]]

- 10:30: it's only 10:30 and already came across a bug in UI apps. Looks like certificates for the ES website is expired or something so every hit to get the data is blocked by chrome. Working on this with platform. Tomorrow's main focus will be peer analysis work. Take time off today.
