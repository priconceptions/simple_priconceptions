[[ 2021-W45]]
## What's up today?
- Work
	- [ ] change the mappings for peer analysis stuff
		- 13:15: currently running the app locally so I can get it working-- maybe it's better to guess and test-- it's easier to set breakpoints and make sure this works. Otherwise I won't even understand where the ES endpoint stuff is being called
- Personal
	- [ ] decide to take the job or not... no more deliberating past today

- Growth

## Logistics
- Sleep time:
- Wake up time:
- Focusmate sessions:
