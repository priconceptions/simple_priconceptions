## How did today go?
- Did you take the easiest route to your goals?

No goals today other than understand wtf stock options are and how I should go about using them. I have made up my mind about Wave. I will be joinign next Wednesday and tell everyone on Wedenesday. Overall, happy about my decision, though it will probably take Dad a bit longer to accept it. I am excited!

Other than this, we went to Dosa Grill for dinner and ate thanli. Also bought Maggi and ate Maggi for lunch. We're being extremely unhealthy these day-- not good! Worked out today too in a while. Not sure why it's so hard for me to stay consistent with my health. I am being extremely irresponsible.

Anyways, overall a good day. Need to think about what's next tomorrow. Thankful for my life today. A lot of good things!
