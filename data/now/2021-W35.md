| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Started the week off really well with thinking about these templates and working on affordableshit                            | Didn't work fast enough. There were a lot of outstanding items left over at the end of a lot of days                     | Schedule 50 minute sessions with either yourself or on focusmate to focus on exactly one thing on your list at a time                          |
| Completely finished the technical aspects of affordableshit.com. Now I need to gather the affordable products and post them   | Didn't give myself time to work on "growth". Because of this, a lot of items are left over at the end of the week        | To actually work on Growth items, schedule a focusmate.com session early in the morning--around 6 am just to do something small in the morning |
| Interviewed well at Bloomberg                                                                                                 | Didn't wake up early any of the days except the days I had an obligation                                                 | Create an obligation to wake up using focusmate. Also use the london writing hour to write blog posts                                          |
| Finished a lot of outstanding personal stuff -- fixed the bike, cut the garden, painted most of the curtain rod               | Spent a lot of time on my phone, distracted, looking at random posts or Instagram                                        | Schedule a time that's unmovable to do financial fridays. Also ask yourself what youre doing to burn the candle on both ends                   |
| Went to the gym or did some sort of physical activity 5 out of 7 days                                                         | Didn't do financial fridays on fridays-- however, ended up doing it on Sunday                                            | Go to settings of Google Calendar and customize it properly. Use it every day to plan and do exactly what you planned                          |
| Planned the next day everyday-- this helped me actually focus on what to do and I ended up doing a lot of things on the lists | The transition periods are the hardest. Use a calendar to plan out your day to actually complete everything on your list | Make a list of influential essays that you love to re-read and when you feel uninspired or just during transitory times, read these            |
