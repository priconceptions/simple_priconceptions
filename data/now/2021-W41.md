| I was on a deadline so worked seriously and time-frugally on birthday bucz                      | Didn't submit the project-- started it way too late and didn't work enough hours to get it done                                            | create hard deadlines and tweet out that you are launching something enw on exactly this date. That way, you have a hard deadline to finish coding |
| Did ANKI after forever. When I was at work, finished all web dev ANKI cards, which was awesome! | Didn't continue to do it every day.                                                                                                        | Have a way to track this visually. I used to track it using a calendar with marks in my notebook. I would love a visual way to do this online.     |
| Started running again and I'm lookign forward to it.                                            | Broke this habit when I came to parents' home. I keep breaking this habit because the environment keeps changing and disrupting my routine | Run at 8:30 am everyday -- think about the best time to run every day so nothing interferes with this time.                                        |
| Super happy and social with roommates                                                           |                                                                                                                                            | talk to them more                                                                                                                                  |
| Cleaned up a lot of my space                                                                    |                                                                                                                                            | Bring sister to home more often ðŸ˜…                                                                                                                 |
