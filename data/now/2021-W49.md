Onto next week, what do I want. If I can get access, I want a clean break from JPMorgan and that will be my main focus. Literally, that's all mentally. Well, that plus the writing everyday. 

Physically, I want to up my exercise intensity. I want to run in the mornings to lose weight and become stronger. I could experiment with skipping breakfast 2 or 3 of the days. And do the home workouts in the evening. (Get interested in the exercise moves... so you can start your own channel)

If I can't get access, one of my things is to clean up my ANKI deck and review it daily. Learn Javascript really well by doing Freecodecamp exercises, adding to ANKI, and also going through [this](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going). Then, create a browser plugin or something-- since it uses pure Javascript. The biggest thing is to get ANKI as a habit because I always forget shit.

I've also wanted to do this thing where I do a project in my backlog every week. I don't know if I should start this shit this week. it's better to start slow. Do one thing at a time and do it well. This week, that will be ANKI and becoming a better programmer.

Also do Sunday Sparks this Sunday.
