## How did today go?
What did you do today? How did you feel today? This is for your [future self](https://sive.rs/dj)

today was good. just a lot more surprises about the cultiure at Wave. Kind of blown away about how transparant everythingis here. Also holy fuck today's Friday and I forgot Financial Fridays.... shit. I guess I'll do it tomorrow when we're watching shows and stuff in the evening. Man I can't be forgetting stuff like this. Financial fridays is the cornerstone of my finances. Dammit. 

Anyways, I'll just do it tomorrow I guess. Also have to do other things like set up a dr's appointment, building the blog. Tomorrow's a busy day with chores in the house and everything else. Don't know if I'll get to these things.
