## How did today go?
What did you do today? How did you feel today? This is for your [future self](https://sive.rs/dj)

What I learned today:
- Holy shit I'm bored today
- I am super tired I dont know why
- I can't do anything and there's no point in forcing myself to do things.
- I will start tomorrow onwards by making a serious effort to improve my productivity. This means:
	- [ ] record my screen as I'm programming to see where I am the slowest and where I can speed up
	- [ ] reflect on my recordings to see where I could go faster.
	- [ ] Write about my reflections and store them here  
	- [ ] At the end of the day, spend 15 mintues reflecting on how I could've improved my speed on the stuff I worked on and how I couldv'e been more effective at what I was doing at the given moment.
	- [ ] On saturdays, spend 1/2 and hour going through howthe previous week went and suggest improvements.


Litereally didn't do anything but read a lot of random blogs + videos. If I can't start I can't do anything.
