## How did today go?
What did you do today? How did you feel today? This is for your [future self](https://sive.rs/dj)

work went really well today. In the morning I recorded myself, which I think made me more efficient. i need to spend some time actually reviewing these recordings and making sure I do the things to make myself faster.

The point is to get mroe work donw in a unit of time so I cna be done with work and do other things that are fun like writing, running, making tiktok videos, opening a Cafe, or making an alarm app that charges you to hit snooze. 

I need to hone my process of workign efficiently. Right now, the biggest thing that is hurting me is my inability to touch type and making a lot of mistakes while I'm typing. it wouldn't hurt to spend like 15 minutes a day just practicing how to touch type so I can get faster.

The point is to free your mental space and not make work sucha hassle.
