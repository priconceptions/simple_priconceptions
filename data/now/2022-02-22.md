## How did today go?
What did you do today? How did you feel today? This is for your [future self](https://sive.rs/dj)

Tuesdays are just high input days-- always. I don't know why... for some reason I can't get anything done on Tuesdays. I have no interest in anything. I did some minor thigns today and called it a day.

Oh well. Tomorrow will be better. I know it.
