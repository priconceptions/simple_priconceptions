## How did today go?
What did you do today? How did you feel today? This is for your [future self](https://sive.rs/dj)

Overall, I was bored af today. Nothing could ignote me to do some work. I guess it's a good thing bc it means what I'm doing is not that interesting right now and it means I don't think it's all that improtant. It's that and also the fact that it was hot af. Also I've sort of forgiven myself for everything that I do this week bc the important thing is to spend some time with my sister.

This doesn't mean I didn't get some stuff done at least. For the home screen redesign, I merged fixes for:
- making the eye icon smaller
- the audio thing got thinner

I'm just unable to generate new things to do. Like all the extracurricular things-- writing, bulding side projects, all those things are hard for me to do right now. And that's fine bc they are, after all, _extra_-curriculars. SO relax, it's not a big deal. Do things that really, _really_ move you and nothing else bc everything else will just drain your energy. And work on things when you have the momentum. Use the momentum of your passion and try to ship soemthing out. This applies to everything-- writing, building side projects, drawing. 

Also capture ideas so you have things to write about, or code about.

Anyways, I was fucked-out-of-my-mind bored today. I don't know whatbut I just couldn't find it in me to do _anything_ at all. There is no cure to fix this in the day. Just make sure you start the next day better.
