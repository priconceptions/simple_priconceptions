# What I'm up to now

## Work
I'm an engineer at Wave, a mobile money platform making Africa a cashless continent. I love my job and I'm usually working on something related to it in my [Focusmate sessions](https://www.focusmate.com/i/NVx59ZDMqI).

Along with Focumate, I have been using the same [Work cycles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfMkd-TaFWO2UsyMIZSzyVQ4EexEKVDkF220onAeie0/copy) spreadsheet (on and off though since it's tiring) for the past 2 years to manage my attention.


## Fitness
I'm training for my first marathon in October using this [training program](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-2-marathon/). I am struggling to recover these days since the weekly mileage has increased. If you have any advice on how you've adjusted to running, [email me pls](mailto:someone@priyankapdhavingfun@gmail.com)

Along with running, I try to lift weights at least twice a week and do other kinds of training -- stretching, at-home pilates, walking -- when I have time.

## Other things

- In the process of moving cities soon
- I cook a lot and enjoy the feeling of others enjoying my food
- Reading [*Maybe You Should Talk to Someone* by Lori Gottlieb](https://www.amazon.com/Maybe-You-Should-Talk-Someone/dp/1328662055)
- I love listening to playlists curated by [Nobody](https://open.spotify.com/user/31hc7ce37wzpxfvfn2lxk2daj76q?si=13feb4abaf1e4298)
