# What I'm up to now

## Work
I'm an engineer at Wave, a mobile money platform making Africa a cashless continent. I'm usually working on something related to my work in my [Focusmate sessions](https://www.focusmate.com/i/NVx59ZDMqI).

Along with Focumate, I have been using the same [Work cycles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfMkd-TaFWO2UsyMIZSzyVQ4EexEKVDkF220onAeie0/copy) spreadsheet (on and off though since it's tiring) for the past 2 years to manage my attention.


## Fitness
Late September and early October, I was burnt out from working out after I finished a trail race in Banff. It was an incredible experience but I had injured my ankle and didn't feel like doing anything for a while.

Thankfully, that ended and I'm back! I like to workout by:
- lifting 3-4 times a week
- running (sprints and longer distances)

And, if it's raining and gloomy:
- pilates videos on YouTube at home
- jump rope at home (unfortunately terrifying the cat)

## Cat
I recently started fostering Sahara from a non-profit called [BronxTails](https://bronxtails.org/). I spend a lot of time fawning over her:

## Other things

- I cook a lot and love the feeling of others enjoying my food
- Listening to playlists curated by [Nobody](https://open.spotify.com/user/31hc7ce37wzpxfvfn2lxk2daj76q?si=13feb4abaf1e4298)
