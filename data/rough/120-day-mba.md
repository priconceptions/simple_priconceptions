According to [this Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/year_progress), we are 66% into 2021. Even though we're so close to the end, there's still 34% of the year left to make it memorable. I've experienced growth in other areas of my life, but my goals to build side projects have stagnated. This challenge is to force me to validate, test, build, and market projects before the year end so that I can look back fondly on an adventurous year.

## **Motivation**

### **I never finish what I've started**

My Github profile is a graveyard of projects that died prematurely. A lot of my projects haven't gone beyond the landing page and sign-up form.

Yet I continue to buy domain names when a "this will definitely make me rich" idea pops into my head.

A lot of us suffer from shiny object syndrome. We seek new things at the expense of perfectly fine old things just because we're bored.

This challenge keeps the project timeline small. I won't have a chance to constantly change my mind and will be forced to finish what I've started.

### **I never launch**

This is a common problem that all creators face. Whether we're writers, developers, or artists, we're too afraid to launch anything into the world that's just enough. Something about putting our names on imperfect work and shipping it out into the world scares us into abandoning it.

For this challenge, I will launch one project—no matter how imperfect—every month. By launch, I mean getting at least one paying customer. This means that I will have to start selling my project even before I make it— something I have never done before. I will also have to work fast and keep my MVPs small.

### **I'm not taking advantage of the internet**

The internet has made it immensely easy to make friends. I've been letting this opportunity go just because I'm uncomfortable (also mostly lazy). It's also the most accessible way to build income streams.

For this challenge, I will be tweeting every day using #Tweet100 to track my progress and motivate me. I will also write weekly and monthly summary reports on what I've done.

### **Creating meaning in my life**

You know that feeling where life seems to have stagnated? When you feel busy but also bored? Maybe it's a quarter-life crisis but I'm having a lot of these feelings lately.

The 120 day MBA will be challenging enough to make me feel like I'm moving forward. It will create a habit of doing something small every single day and sharing it with the world. If I summarize my life in a bulleted list, I hope this challenge will occupy its own bullet.

## **How I'm going to do these things**

### **Acquiring knowledge**

I don't have a formal way I'm thinking of acquiring knowledge. I won't be reading books or seeking resources until I'm facing something I don't know. I will update this article with the resources I did find helpful.

For my tech stack, I will use NextJS on the front end and Supabase on the backend. These frameworks make app development super easy. I can’t spend time worrying about tech frameworks if I want to acquire a paying customer every month. My goal is to keep the MVPs super small and focus on marketing.

### **Solidifying my understanding**

In sum, this is what I will do for the next 120 days:

1.  Weekly reports on what I did this week. What went well. What I could improve.
2.  At least one tweet a day. Use #Tweet100 for inspiration and accountability
3.  One launch per month. Remember, launch=one paying customer
4.  Writing longer reports on what happened in the month and what I could do better for the next month.
