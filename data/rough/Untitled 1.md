Every couple of months, I see a tweet that goes like this:

"Adult friendships are asking someone to get coffee sometime soon and never actually getting that coffee."

When we're young, it's easy to make and keep friends because we are forced to be in each others' presence for some period of time. In class, at the field, at your extracurricular venue-- you'll see the your friend and start talking to them.

Also, there seems to be unlimited time and energy to actually get together with people. 

Now, as an adult, although I have the freedom to go wherever I want and hang out with my friends, it rarely happens.

Life gets in the way. I got sick. Things came up. I've been low these past few days.

I wonder if these are all just excuses to avoid putting in the work to plan events.

My mom has this ritual-- every Thursday, she calls her brother, every Fridey another brother, every Saturday-- her sister, and every Sunday, a wildcard (a friend we haven't talked to in a while).

And every holiday, she makes a point to wish everyone she knows.
