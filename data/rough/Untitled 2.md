My friend recently had a bad promotion. She got a raise but not as much as her colleagues did.

Some people in my friend group chided her. How could you be so ungrateful? You sound privileged. 

Some people told her to relax. You're young. You have plenty of time to make money. Just chill and do your job.

Here's my take.

If you're going to be in a race, then make sure you put in the effort needed to win. If you get cheated, demand justice. Don't crap out.

Or, don't enroll in the race at all.

My friend (the one who got the raise) worked just as hard as her peers. If there was something concrete she needs to improve upon, then
