I've always hated myself for not being able to focus as much. Having read Deep Work, I understand the importance of sitting down and focusing at least for a few hours everyday. However, what I've noticed is that I can't go more than 2 hours of focus at a time. The amount of focus time has dimishing returns. The first 2 hours are amazing and productive. The last couple of minutes, I am just completing my focus time but not really getting any work done.

I've hated this and envied those people who seem to be able to focus for 4-5 hours at a time. 

Also, I've begun to feel more guilty about it because at Wave, there are barely any meetings or other kinds of shallow work. A lot of time should be dedicated for focus and deep work.

So, if I can't focus during the long blocks of nothing, and I don't have any shallow work to do, what am I even doing?

I'm on my phone, or I'm doing other errands. Overall, I am not getting and work work done.

There's one part of my life that I've been trying to improve for years but haven't made any progress-- increasing the  number of hard, think, focus time in a day. 

Having read Deep Work, I am amazed by the people who can do long hours of focused work. I understand the importance of focusing.

But whenever I get down to it, I just cannot focus for more than 2 hours. 

Whenever I go more than 2 hours, the first 2 hours are amazing, productive. If not that, then at least I understand what's preventing progress-- I can pinpoint a bug or say I just don't understand the mechanics of this so it's not working; I need to read some documentation.

However, if I get stuck on a bug on the 2 hour mark, I am compelled to keep going. But the 3rd hour and 4th hour are just me waddling around, trying different shitty ideas but not really getting anywhere.

This self-loathing problem has gotten worse since I joined Wave because I don't have much shallow work. Most of the tasks assigned are at least an hour long. I barely have any meetings. Most of my day is large chunks of nothing. 

Which is amazing in literally every aspect! I don't have to worry about rescheduling my entire day if I have to run an errand.

But, the issue is that if I'm not doing any shallow work and if I physically can't do any more deep work without babbling around like an idiot, then I'm not doing any work. Years of conditioning in a corporate office tells me this is bad.

(Note: No one at Wave has told me I should work for for X amount of hours. And there are no deadlines at Wave, so there's nothing forcing me to finish work at a certain time. It's just my own guilty concious eating at my peace)

So, it was nice to read

Not sure what to write. i am jsut testing my new keyboard. It is super pretty but I'm not sure how much I like it yet. I will know more tomorrow when I have really really used it. Still feels weird to have these circular keys. Feels super pink an not sure if I like it yet. But I will get used to the keys and it's not even like I am the best typist so I can't even blame the keyboard. I can only blame myslef. Let's see how it goes. If it's terrible, I will just get another keyboard. It was only $30 anyways. I can use this on my phone and iPad too-- which is awesome. One thing that I'm noticing that I don't like is the spacebar. It is quite annoying.

Also I need to get used to not using the trackpad to see all my screens. It's `cmd+tab` now
