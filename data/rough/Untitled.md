Today, for the first time, I was working on an Android project. Even though I had Android Studio installed on my computer, the only reason I open it is to check that our app looks the same on Android as it does on iOS. 

The worst part of working with new technology is the setup. There's always something weird that comes up that I spend hours frantically googling. Today, in Android Studio, I couldn't get the SDK's java to sync with what I had on my computer. After trying to fix this for hours, I finally gave up and nuked Android Studio off my computer and reinstalled it.

Everything worked then. Phew.

When I was debugging this issue, I noticed that there are thousands of tutorials on how to build an app, how to build a website, or how to pass your technical interviews, with no opinionated, clear instructions on how to set up your computer so you can do your job well.

The main barrier for me when starting with any new technology is the setup. I can't build an app (at least enjoyably) if I can't get the red squiggly error lines to go away! 

Starting with teaching people how to build apps without teaching them how to set up their environment is like teaching a child how to cook and saute vegetables before teaching them how to hold a knife and not cut their hand off.

I would prefer it if someone gave me opinionated advice on setup. Look-- this is how you set up iTerm and not use your ugly old terminal and type `cd home/blah/blah/blah` every single time you need to get to the main directory. 

I get why people in tech don't like to give opinionated feedback-- real life is much more nuanced, and you will probably end up with junk if you followed everyone's advice. But maybe we could find a balance between feeding people things they don't need and throwing them into the wild.
